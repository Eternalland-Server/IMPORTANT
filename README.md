# IMPORTANT

This repository is an archive of all development projects for a Minecraft RPG server called `EternalLand`. The only developers are [@justwei](https://github.com/xxxijustwei) and [@kirraObj](https://github.com/CziSKY), and In the middle of 2022 the project was cancelled for some reason.

We decided to keep all its development stuff on this repository, Note that **we will not be doing maintenance or replying your issue**.

You are probably able to find some useful code / development ideas in the repository. Most of the projects I maintain for maybe trashily written, especially in terms of part of hardcode.

The development time was the happiest time of my life so far, thank you so much [@justwei](https://github.com/xxxijustwei) and my ex-boss.
