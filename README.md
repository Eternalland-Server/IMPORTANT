# IMPORTANT

This repository is an archive of all development projects for a Minecraft RPG server called `EternalLand`. The only developers are [@justwei](https://github.com/xxxijustwei) and [@kirraObj](https://github.com/CziSKY) and in the middle of 2022, The project was cancelled for some reason.

We decided to leave all of its development materials on this repository. Please understand that **We will not be doing maintenance or replying to your issue**.

You might be able to find some useful code / development ideas in the repository. Some of the projects I maintain were very likely trashily written, particularly in terms of hardcode.

The development period was the happiest of my life so far; thank you so much [@justwei](https://github.com/xxxijustwei) and to my ex-boss.
